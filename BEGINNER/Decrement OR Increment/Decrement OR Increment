Write a program to obtain a number N and increment its value by 1 if the number is divisible by 4 otherwise decrement its value by 1.

Input:
First line will contain a number N.

Output:
Output a single line, the new value of the number.

Constraints:
0≤N≤1000

Sample Input:
5

Sample Output:
4

EXPLANATION:
Since 5 is not divisible by 4 hence, its value is decreased by 1.
